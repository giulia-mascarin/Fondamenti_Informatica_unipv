# University of Pavia: 'Fondamenti di Informatica' Lab Solutions (Academic Year 2020/2021)

Welcome to my collection of lab solutions for the **'Fondamenti di Informatica'** course, taken at the **University of Pavia** during my first year (**academic year 2020/2021**).

### What's Inside?
You'll find my implementations for the lab tasks, which can be found on the official course website: [https://robot.unipv.it/tutorati-fdi](https://robot.unipv.it/tutorati-fdi)

### Why This Repository?
These programs were developed under the guidance of a tutor and successfully passed all `pvcheck` tests. While I've aimed for correctness and functionality, please note that these solutions reflect the perspective and learning journey of a first-year university student. Therefore, they might not always represent the most optimized or elegant approach, but they serve as a working reference.

Feel free to explore, learn from, or use these solutions as a starting point for your own work!
