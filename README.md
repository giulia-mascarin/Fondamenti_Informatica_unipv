# University of Pavia: 'Fondamenti di Informatica' Lab & Exam Solutions (Academic Year 2020/2021)

Welcome to my comprehensive collection of solutions for the **'Fondamenti di Informatica'** course, taken at the **University of Pavia** during my first year (**academic year 2020/2021**).

This repository now includes:

### Lab Solutions
You'll find my implementations for the official lab tasks, which can be found on the course's website: [https://robot.unipv.it/tutorati-fdi](https://robot.unipv.it/tutorati-fdi).

### Exam Examples (Prove d'Esame)
I've also integrated solutions for several exam examples proposed during the 2020/2021 academic year. Please note the following regarding these additions:
* **Missing Task Files:** For the 'partite' and 'vacanze' exercises, the original task descriptions aren't available in this repository.
* **No Test Data:** I do not have example test data for any of the included exam solutions.

### Why This Repository?
All programs, both lab and exam solutions, were developed under the guidance of a tutor and successfully passed all `pvcheck` tests at the time of completion. While I've aimed for correctness and functionality, these solutions reflect the perspective and learning journey of a first-year university student. Therefore, they might not always represent the most optimized or elegant approach, but they serve as a working reference.
